- 👋 Hi, I’m @motoRider8866
- 👀 Bringing the possibility of making just about any idea a reality is what I strive to achive........
- 🌱 I’m currently learning core java, spring framework and last but not the least AI (because why not, it's hot stuff)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that have fresh out of the oven tech (R & D is more like it, don't you agree...)
- 📫 How to reach me >> I doubt you'll need this ;)
